  ## Description:
  This project utilises node.js and inquirer in order to create an application that takes user input to form a development team (includes manager, engineer and intern positions). The user input is captured and html is dynamically created to build a webpage that shows the team. The html is built with bootstrap and a css stylesheet is also built.
